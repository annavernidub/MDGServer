                <p>As part of a regional initiative to reduce risk of drought in Eastern Africa with Early Warning Systems, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Uganda is collecting geo-spatial and qualitative data about community animal health workers and providers of veterinary services and shops, among the rural pastoral communities of the Karamoja region.</p>
                <p>The move from paper-based questionnaires to Microsoft Data Gathering has allowed more efficient operations by reducing the time to produce Drought Bulletins by 50%.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, the project has enhanced participation of the community and the local government, and is supporting the capacity of the Department of Meteorology in issuing monthly weather updates for Karamoja.</p>
                <p>FAO's efforts were recognized by the World Bank in recent study on mobile applications for the agriculture and forestry sector, published in December 2013.</p>

                <p>An official identity is the foundation for child rights, child protection and later child's ticket to services such as secondary schooling. Official identity is obtained by parents through birth registration.</p>

                <p>Poor accessibility to offices and officers, slow processing of both birth notifications and certificates, and costs involved together with a lack of incentives for parents to register their children contribute to the current situation.</p>
                <p>Plan together with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Finland is running a universal birth registration project in the Kwale district using Microsoft Data Gathering that has resulted in dramatically increased registration rates (from 30 to 68%).</p>
